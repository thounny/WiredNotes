#### Video Demo: <URL HERE> TODO

#### Description:

Create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) note-taking application using vanilla JavaScript. This application will enable users to manage their notes effectively by allowing them to add new notes, view existing notes, update notes, and delete notes as needed. The app will store notes locally on the user's device, providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing personal notes.

## Key Features

- **Create:** Users can add new notes by entering text into an input field and clicking a "Save" button.
- **Read:** Existing notes will be displayed in a list format, showing the title and content of each note.
- **Update:** Users can edit the content of existing notes by clicking on them, making changes, and saving the updates.
- **Delete:** Notes can be deleted individually by clicking a "Delete" button associated with each note.

## Additional Features

- **Local Storage:** Notes will be stored locally using the browser's local storage API, ensuring that users can access their notes even after closing the browser.
- **Responsive Design:** The app will be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive controls and clear visual feedback will ensure ease of use for all users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage:** Local Storage API for persistent data storage
- **Framework/Libraries:** Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks)
